# Management App

This an admin we page, made in angular, graphql, apollo, nodejs, mongo and Docker.

## Getting Started

Make sure you have docker installed.

clone management-frontend fron backend branch and make sure is on employment directory

clone management-backend fron master branch and make sure is on employment-server directory

Outside of those directories there must be 'docker-compose.yml' file. So on this route run:

`docker-compose up`

So in <http://localhost:3000> should be your frontend, and in <http://localhost:4000/graphql> your graphl interface.

All files should be in that way. In order to 'docker-compose.yml' runs correctly.
